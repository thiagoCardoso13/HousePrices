## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** – Data manipulation
- **Seaborn**, **Matplotlib** – Data visualization
- **Scikit-Learn** – Machine learning models (Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge, Gradient Boosting)
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Development environment

## 💡 Key Steps

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Identified missing values, outliers, and correlations
   - Visualized distributions and relationships between variables

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handled missing values with context-aware strategies
   - Applied label encoding and one-hot encoding for categorical variables
   - Performed feature scaling and transformation

3. **Modeling:**
   - Trained and compared various regression models:
     - Linear Regression  
     - Lasso & Ridge Regression  
     - Gradient Boosting Regressor
   - Applied **Cross-Validation** and **Grid Search** for hyperparameter tuning

4. **Evaluation:**
   - Used RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) as the evaluation metric
   - Visualized predictions vs actual values
